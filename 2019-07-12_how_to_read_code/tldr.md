### TL;DR:

- use atom + hydrogen (jupyter)
- don't be afraid to copy and paste* at the start
- get to an output as quickly as possible
- if the code is encapsulated in a class, chop off the head...
- ...and use a "self" mock object instead
- rerun all attributes and methods to make sure you didn't break anything
- start inspecting those blocks and/or lines that do all the heavy lifting
- if something is especially complex, use some hydrogen inlining
- peek inside of iterables by exploding them with list
- de-loop all dee loops
- try to slim down and replicate outputs from "borrowed" code
- if you're working with matrices use labelbinarizer
- make sure everything works after refactoring...
- ...and before you toss it back into a class
