ODSC • Boston 

May 2, 2019, 3:00pm (Room 203)

**Abstract:** `y=mx+b` is foundational and incredibly powerful. But, it's frequently abused and misused...

**Bio:** Max is a Lead Instructor at General Assembly and an Apress Author. He likes climbing, making pottery, and fantasy sports. This will be his fourth ODSC!
