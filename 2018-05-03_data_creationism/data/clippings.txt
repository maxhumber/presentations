We are used to loving others in return for what they can do for us, for their capacity to entertain, charm, or soothe us. Yet babies can do precisely nothing. There is, as slightly older children sometimes conclude with serious discomfiture, no “point” to them; that is their point. They teach us to give without expecting anything in return, simply because they need help badly—and we are in a position to provide it.

there is no communication. Shannon’s most radical insight was that meaning is irrelevant. To paraphrase Laplace, meaning was a hypothesis Shannon had no need of. Shannon’s concept of information is instead tied to chance. This is not just because noise randomly scrambles messages. Information exists only when the sender is saying something that the recipient doesn’t already know and can’t predict. Because true information is unpredictable, it is essentially a series of random events like spins of a roulette wheel or rolls of dice. If meaning is excluded from

Example: The tote-board odds for Secretariat are 5 to 1. Odds are a fraction—5 to 1 means 5/1 or 5. The 5 is all you need. The wire service’s tips convince you that Secretariat actually has a 1-in-3 chance of winning. Then by betting $100 on Secretariat you stand a 1/3 chance of ending up with $600. On the average, that is worth $200, a net profit of $100. The edge is the $100 profit divided by the $100 wager, or simply 1. The Kelly formula, edge/odds, is 1/5. This means that you should bet one-fifth of your bankroll on Secretariat.

In the 1966 revision of Beat the Dealer, Thorp described a superior “point count” strategy. (Still popular today, this system is also known as “high-low.”) You count +1 for every low card you see played (2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) and -1 for every high card (10 or ace). This is easier than it sounds. High and low cards can be mentally paired off (and cancel out). This system is better than the ten-count at gauging deck conditions.

You may remember from school that there are two kinds of “averages.” The arithmetic average (or mean) is the plain-vanilla kind. It’s what you get when you add up a list of values and divide by the number of values in the list. It’s what batting averages are, and what an Excel spreadsheet calculates when you enter the formula =AVERAGE ( ). The geometric mean is the one that most people forget after high school. It is calculated by multiplying a list of n values together, then taking the nth root of the product.

The geometric mean criterion can also resolve the Hamlet-like indecision of mean-variance analysis. It singles out one portfolio as “best.” Markowitz noted that the geometric mean can be estimated from the standard (arithmetic) mean and variance. The geometric mean is approximately the arithmetic mean minus one-half the variance. This estimate may be made more precise by incorporating further statistical measures. One additional name must be added as codiscoverer/midwife of the Kelly or geometric mean criterion.

Shannon described a way to make money off a random walk. He asked the audience to consider a stock whose price jitters up and down randomly, with no overall upward or downward trend. Put half your capital into the stock and half into a “cash” account. Each day, the price of the stock changes. At noon each day, you “rebalance” the portfolio. That means you figure out what the whole portfolio (stock plus cash account) is presently worth, then shift assets from stock to cash account or vice versa in order to recover the original 50–50 proportions of stock and cash.

From the point of view of practical computing, factorials are really bad news, because the running time of a factorial algorithm can quickly escalate into billions of years. So the only practical algorithms are those for problems whose solutions can be expressed as polynomials (e.g., n-squared or n-cubed, where n is the number of nodes), because running times for them increase much more slowly than those for factorial or exponential functions.

For instance, marital therapists have identified nineteen independent factors essential to a happy marriage: compatibility about sex, money, religion, politics, in-laws, child-rearing, styles of arguing, and twelve other factors. If a couple agrees about eighteen of those factors but can’t resolve a disagreement just about sex (or just about money, or just religion, etc.), they are in deep trouble. Hence if you hear a newly married couple ask you in all seriousness, “What is the single most important requirement for a happy marriage?” you can bet that that marriage will end in divorce.

Psychologist David Weikart’s famous longitudinal studies of early childhood education found that preschoolers in a low-income neighborhood who were subjected to direct instruction in skills like reading and arithmetic later displayed deficits in social and emotional development vis-à-vis their counterparts in the studies whose preschool education was “play based.” Those schooled by direct instruction were, at age twenty-three, found to have more instances of friction with other people, and more evidence of emotional impairment.

We mentioned that filmmakers like to explore these ideas. Alex Garland’s original script for Ex Machina, one of the more recent entries (at this writing) in the robot-run-amok film category, puts a question on the table about art. The reclusive AI scientist who sets its plot in motion reveals in one scene that he owns a Jackson Pollock painting—or maybe he doesn’t. He programmed a painting robot to replicate exactly the Pollock he had purchased and then, with the two indistinguishable, randomly chose one and had it destroyed.

“back-propagation.” It’s really just the chain rule—a simple calculus trick—applied in an elegant way. It’s a deep integration of continuous and discrete math, enabling complex families of potential solutions to be autonomously improved with vector calculus. The key is to organize the template of potential solutions as a directed graph (e.g., from a photo to a generated caption, with many nodes in between). Traversing this graph in reverse enables the algorithm to automatically compute a “gradient vector,” which directs the search for increasingly better solutions.

Every society that has ever existed has had to channel and subdue certain aspects of human nature—envy, territorial violence, avarice, deceit, laziness, cheating, etc.—through social mechanisms and institutions. It would be a miracle if all societies—irrespective of size, geographical location, their place in history, or the genomes of their members—had done this equally well.

Many assert that, while they can get along just fine without an imaginary friend, most human beings will always need to believe in God. In my experience, people holding this opinion never seem to notice how condescending, unimaginative, and pessimistic a view it is of the rest of humanity—and of generations to come.

truth has nothing, in principle, to do with consensus: one person can be right, and everyone else can be wrong. Consensus is a guide to discovering what is going on in the world, but that is all that it is. Its presence or absence in no way constrains what may or may not be true.

Donald Symons that captures the problem of multiculturalism especially well: If only one person in the world held down a terrified, struggling, screaming little girl, cut off her genitals with a septic blade, and sewed her back up, leaving only a tiny hole for urine and menstrual flow, the only question would be how severely that person should be punished, and whether the death penalty would be a sufficiently severe sanction. But when millions of people do this, instead of the enormity being magnified millions-fold, suddenly it becomes “culture,” and thereby magically becomes less, rather than more, horrible, and is even defended by some Western “moral thinkers,” including feminists.29

A mutually agreed time tax had been enacted, such that a portion of the income and toil of those who had recently arrived on the island would go to those who had been there for decades, and this time tax was tapered in both directions, becoming a smaller and smaller sliver as one continued to reside, and then a larger and larger subsidy thereafter.

There are many other features of our subjectivity that have implications for morality. For instance, people tend to evaluate an experience based on its peak intensity (whether positive or negative) and the quality of its final moments. In psychology, this is known as the “peak/end rule.” Testing this rule in a clinical environment, one group found that patients undergoing colonoscopies (in the days when this procedure was done without anesthetic) could have their perception of suffering markedly reduced, and their likelihood of returning for a follow-up exam increased, if their physician needlessly prolonged the procedure at its lowest level of discomfort by leaving the colonoscope inserted for a few extra minutes.37 The same principle seems to hold for aversive sounds38 and for exposure to cold.39 Such findings suggest that, under certain conditions, it is compassionate to prolong a person’s pain unnecessarily so as to reduce his memory of suffering later on.

By ‘best’, we mean that this is a shape that fits together leaving no gaps and covers the maximum area possible for the length of its edges. The winner is the hexagon, as was discovered by bees long before humans even conceived of mathematics.

If bacteria cannot multiply because their DNA is tangled, then the infection they are causing cannot spread. In a very similar way, when human cells run amok and become cancerous, tying their DNA in a knot could be a way to stop a tumour from growing. A future wave of anti-bacterials and medical therapies therefore depends on us expanding our mathematical understanding of knots.

The units column is easy: 1 + 0 = 1, so we can write a 1 under that. The next column is slightly harder: we need to add 1 and 1. The normal answer would be 2, but this is binary and there is no symbol for ‘two’, so we can’t put a 2 as part of the answer. Two, after all, is 10 in binary. So we do the same thing we would do in normal base-10 arithmetic and ‘carry’ the 1 – which makes nice sense: this column is the 2s column, so we’re adding one 2 to another 2, which gives us one 4 to carry over to the next column.

I find it fascinating that regular shapes can go from there being infinitely many in 2D, to five and six options in 3D and 4D respectively, and then suddenly only three for all other dimensions. The problem with 2D is that there aren’t enough options to place any significant constraints on regular shapes: they’re allowed to run wild. 2D is too limited to have any nuanced behaviour. 3D and 4D are the sweet-spot for enough freedom to build something interesting but there not being too many options to ruin everything. From 5D onwards, there’s too much freedom to be able to lock anything down. For me, this explains why we live in a universe with around three to four dimensions: it’s enough to make the options interesting, but not too many that any attempt at anything too complex falls apart. Throw in the lack of knots and orbits in 4D and it tips the scales to why we experience a 3D reality.

There is an interesting side-effect from taking the infinite range of nuanced colours available in nature and converting them all to one of only 16,777,216 possible RGB values (28 × 28 × 28 = 16,777,216). Encoding something in numbers takes the infinite possibilities of the world around us and traps them in a finite range of values. For example, the iPhone5 has a screen with a resolution of 1,136 pixels by 640 pixels, a total of 727,040 different pixels. Each of those 727,040 pixels must be one of the 16,777,216 possible RGB colours, which means that the screen on an iPhone can only show 16,777,216727,040 different images. Don’t get me wrong, that is a massive number. Written out in base-10, it has 5,252,661 digits. But it is finite. Every image you have ever seen on an iPhone is just one of those pre-determined values.

If you ask people to report on their level of well-being moment-to-moment—by giving them a beeper that sounds at random intervals, prompting them to record their mental state—you get one measure of how happy they are. If, however, you simply ask them how satisfied they are with their lives generally, you often get a very different measure.

The census had shown that some London boroughs were already lacking in ‘diversity’. Not because there weren’t enough people of immigrant origin but because there weren’t enough white British people still around to make those boroughs diverse.

Perhaps instead of simply celebrating such levels of immigration it would make matters easier if the proponents of mass immigration revealed what levels of ‘diversity’ they would like to get to and what they see as their optimal target figure? Is a ceiling of 25 per cent white Britons in London — or the country at large — a target? Or should it be 10 per cent? Or none at all? A final, and perhaps harder, question to ask would be when, if at all, given the range of claims against them, these ‘white Britons’ might ever be able to acceptably argue, let alone complain, about their odds?

UCL’s own research quietly showed was that non-EEA migrants had actually taken out around £95 billion more in services than they had paid in in taxes, meaning that if you took the period 1995–2011 and included all immigrants (not just a convenient high net-worth selection), then by UCL’s own measurements, immigrants to the United Kingdom had taken out significantly more than they had put in. Mass migration, in other words, had made the country very significantly poorer over the period in question.

the economic benefits of immigration accrue almost solely to the migrant. It is migrants who are able to access public facilities they have not previously paid for. It is migrants who benefit from a wage higher than they could earn in their home country. And very often the money that they earn – or much of it – is sent to family outside the United Kingdom rather than even being put back into the local economy.

What is more, it had all been done on the laughable presumption that while all cultures are equal, European cultures are less equal than others. And that a person who favoured the culture of Germany over that of Eritrea had, in the most gracious interpretation, an out-of-date or ill-informed opinion, and in the more common view was simply an out-and-out racist.

Domestically, the situation has the potential to become infinitely worse. Just one consequence of having ‘diversity’ and ‘difference’ rather than ‘colour blindness’ and proper integration as a goal is that Europe in the twenty-first century is obsessed with race. Rather than diminishing, the subject grows larger by the day.

For men, it’s 76.4.65 The gender health gap is very real, unlike the gender wage gap, which is completely explained by life choices.

How many young college graduates have taken demanding jobs in high-powered firms, vowing that they will work hard to earn money that will enable them to retire and pursue their real interests when they are thirty-five? But by the time they reach that age, they have large mortgages, children to school, houses in the suburbs that necessitate at least two cars per family, and a sense that life is not worth living without really good wine and expensive holidays abroad. What are they supposed to do, go back to digging up roots? No, they double their efforts and keep slaving away.

One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can’t live without it. Let’s take another familiar example from our own time.

Most people wrote and received no more than a handful of letters a month and seldom felt compelled to reply immediately. Today I receive dozens of emails each day, all from people who expect a prompt reply. We thought we were saving time; instead we revved up the treadmill of life to ten times its former speed and made our days more anxious and agitated.

The writer’s work is merely a kind of optical instrument which he offers to the reader to enable him to discern what, without this book, he would perhaps never have experienced in himself. And the recognition by the reader in his own self of what the book says is the proof of its veracity.

The images with which we are surrounded are often not just out-of-date, they can also be unhelpfully ostentatious. When Proust urges us to evaluate the world properly, he repeatedly reminds us of the value of modest scenes. Chardin opens our eyes to the beauty of saltcellars and jugs; the madeleine delights the narrator by evoking memories of an ordinary bourgeois childhood; Elstir paints nothing grander than cotton dresses and harbors. In Proust’s view, such modesty is characteristic of beauty.

People often think that the best way to predict the future is by collecting as much data as possible before making a decision. But this is like driving a car looking only at the rearview mirror—because data is only available about the past. Indeed, while experiences and information can be good teachers, there are many times in life where we simply cannot afford to learn on the job. You don’t want to have to go through multiple marriages to learn how to be a good spouse. Or wait until your last child has grown to master parenthood.

capital that seeks growth before profits is bad capital. But the reason why both types of capital appear in the name of the theory is that once a viable strategy has been found, investors need to change what they seek—they should become impatient for growth and patient for profit. Once a profitable and viable way forward has been discovered—success now depends on scaling out this model.

The alternative to this approach is to focus on the opposite: invest to see a business grow big quickly and figure out how to be profitable down the line. This is what Motorola did with Iridium. History is littered with failed companies that tried to take this path; it’s almost always an ineffective shortcut to success.

These richer interactions they called “language dancing.” Language dancing is being chatty, thinking aloud, and commenting on what the child is doing and what the parent is doing or planning to do. “Do you want to wear the blue shirt or the red shirt today?” “Do you think it will rain today?” “Do you remember the time I put your bottle in the oven by mistake?” and so on. Language dancing involves talking to the child about “what if,” and “do you remember,” and “wouldn’t it be nice if”—questions that invite the child to think deeply about what is happening around him.

What do I mean by that? We don’t go through life conforming to particular demographic segments: nobody buys a product because he is an eighteen- to thirty-five-year-old white male getting a college degree. That may be correlated with a decision to buy this product instead of that one, but it doesn’t cause us to buy anything.

Ironically, it is for this reason that many unhappy marriages are often built upon selflessness. But the selflessness is based on the partners giving each other things that they want to give, and which they have decided that their partner ought to want—as in, “Honey, believe me, you are going to love this Iridium wireless telephone!”

This may sound counterintuitive, but I deeply believe that the path to happiness in a relationship is not just about finding someone who you think is going to make you happy. Rather, the reverse is equally true: the path to happiness is about finding someone who you want to make happy, someone whose happiness is worth devoting yourself to. If what causes us to fall deeply in love is mutually understanding and then doing each other’s job to be done, then I have observed that what cements that commitment is the extent to which I sacrifice myself to help her succeed and for her to be happy.

men are more emotional than women, and at least as into commitment—not less.  When they fall in love, it’s harder and faster23; they fall out of love more slowly, they’re less likely to break up, and more likely to remarry24; they grieve longer when relationships end25.  They get more upset during arguments, and cool down slower26.  They want and need love.

He doesn’t think he deserves it or she owes it to him (unless he is also an entitled douchebag, which is entirely possible)—he just expects that he’s going to get it, even before he says a word. Why? Because he’s done this dozens if not hundreds of times, with enough success to accurately predict the likely outcome.

If I had to wait a year before making this choice, would I choose to do this? • The hero/villain heuristic: If I were watching a movie in which a guy was doing this with a woman, would the audience be rooting for him as the hero or booing him as the villain? • The YouTube heuristic: If she recorded this whole scene with a hidden videocam and posted it to YouTube, would I be ashamed or proud? • The female friend heuristic: If a guy I didn’t know was doing this to my best female friend, would I want to kill him or thank him? • The ancestral pride heuristic: If all of my long-dead male ancestors could see me doing this, would they say, “OMG, all the millions of man-years of blood, sweat, tears, heartbreak, and suffering we endured to produce this guy were totally worth it; we are so proud of him!” • The willpower heuristic: If I had stronger willpower right now, what would I do?

In modern culture, we’re told that choosing mates for their physical health and physical attractiveness is superficial. That is a bullshit lie. Picking people based on their looks is an evolved behavior, especially with regard to health, because health is the exact opposite of a superficial trait: it’s how well your whole body works as an organic system.

The Four Basic Principles of Effective Strength Workouts 1. GO HEAVY: Move heavy loads, not light weights. You don’t get stronger without stressing your muscles, and the way to do that is with weights that are heavy (for you). 2. GO FAST: If you move heavy weights with very high intensity (i.e., as fast as you can, without hurting yourself, of course), that is even better. Short workouts that are very intense are much better than longer workouts at a lower intensity. 3. DO COMPOUND MOVEMENTS: All exercises should consist of natural, complex movements. Your body includes 206 bones and over 650 skeletal muscles. Whole-body and compound-movement exercises, like push-ups, pull-ups, and squats, use dozens of muscles to stabilize and move multiple joints. Compound movements are more efficient at training both major and minor muscles, and they build the coordination, balance, and flexibility needed to move in diverse, natural ways. Isolation movements should be avoided—no curls for the girls, no pecs for effects. They overtrain big muscles and neglect small supportive muscles and connective tissues, thus increasing injury risk. 4. NO CHRONIC CARDIO: Spending a lot of time doing cardio is not only a waste of time, but it can undermine your health by flooding your body with stress hormones, reducing sex hormones, and driving you to eat more grains and sugars. This is especially true for long-endurance, low-intensity cardio, like jogging or leisurely use of the elliptical machine.

The idea that bars and clubs are good places for men to meet women goes against everything in human biology.

If you’re still not convinced, look at it like this: on a deep, primal level a woman’s worst fear is that a man will assault her, and a man’s worst fear is that a woman will sexually humiliate him. BOTH of these elements are directly in play at bars and clubs. It literally puts men and women into the worst possible situations for mating.

Nevertheless, the modern Indian state is a child of the British Empire. The British killed, injured and persecuted the inhabitants of the subcontinent, but they also united a bewildering mosaic of warring kingdoms, principalities and tribes, creating a shared national consciousness and a country that functioned more or less as a single political unit.

How many Indians today would want to call a vote to divest themselves of democracy, English, the railway network, the legal system, cricket and tea on the grounds that they are imperial legacies? And if they did, wouldn’t the very act of calling a vote to decide the issue demonstrate their debt to their former overlords?

Nobody really knows how to solve this thorny question of cultural inheritance. Whatever path we take, the first step is to acknowledge the complexity of the dilemma and to accept that simplistically dividing the past into good guys and bad guys leads nowhere. Unless, of course, we are willing to admit that we usually follow the lead of the bad guys.

Gautama found that there was a way to exit this vicious circle. If, when the mind experiences something pleasant or unpleasant, it simply understands things as they are, then there is no suffering. If you experience sadness without craving that the sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness but you do not suffer from it. There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without losing your peace of mind.

The modern age has witnessed the rise of a number of new natural-law religions, such as liberalism, Communism, capitalism, nationalism and Nazism. These creeds do not like to be called religions, and refer to themselves as ideologies. But this is just a semantic exercise. If a religion is a system of human norms and values that is founded on belief in a superhuman order, then Soviet Communism was no less a religion than Islam.

Chaotic systems come in two shapes. Level one chaos is chaos that does not react to predictions about it. The weather, for example, is a level one chaotic system. Though it is influenced by myriad factors, we can build computer models that take more and more of them into consideration, and produce better and better weather forecasts. Level two chaos is chaos that reacts to predictions about it, and therefore can never be predicted accurately. Markets, for example, are a level two chaotic system.

In just this fashion, cultural ideas live inside the minds of humans. They multiply and spread from one host to another, occasionally weakening the hosts and sometimes even killing them. A cultural idea – such as belief in Christian heaven above the clouds or Communist paradise here on earth – can compel a human to dedicate his or her life to spreading that idea, even at the price of death. The human dies, but the idea spreads. According to this approach, cultures are not conspiracies concocted by some people in order to take advantage of others (as Marxists tend to think). Rather, cultures are mental parasites that emerge accidentally, and thereafter take advantage of all people infected by them.

Today all humans are, to a much greater extent than they usually want to admit, European in dress, thought and taste. They may be fiercely anti-European in their rhetoric, but almost everyone on the planet views politics, medicine, war and economics through European eyes, and listens to music written in European modes with words in European languages. Even today’s burgeoning Chinese economy, which may soon regain its global primacy, is built on a European model of production and finance.

Everything depends on the people in the labs. New discoveries in fields such as biotechnology and nanotechnology could create entire new industries, whose profits could back the trillions of make-believe money that the banks and governments have created since 2008.

Romantic literature often presents the individual as somebody caught in a struggle against the state and the market. Nothing could be further from the truth. The state and the market are the mother and father of the individual, and the individual can survive only thanks to them. The market provides us with work, insurance and a pension. If we want to study a profession, the government’s schools are there to teach us. If we want to open a business, the bank loans us money. If we want to build a house, a construction company builds it and the bank gives us a mortgage, in some cases subsidised or insured by the state. If violence flares up, the police protect us. If we are sick for a few days, our health insurance takes care of us.

We can choose our spouses, friends and neighbours, but they can choose to leave us. With the individual wielding unprecedented power to decide her own path in life, we find it ever harder to make commitments. We thus live in an increasingly lonely world of unravelling communities and families.

evolution provided pleasant feelings as rewards to males who spread their genes by having sex with fertile females. If sex were not accompanied by such pleasure, few males would bother. At the same time, evolution made sure that these pleasant feelings quickly subsided. If orgasms were to last for ever, the very happy males would die of hunger for lack of interest in food, and would not take the trouble to look for additional fertile females.

When the pursuit stops, the mind becomes very relaxed, clear and satisfied. All kinds of feelings go on arising and passing – joy, anger, boredom, lust – but once you stop craving particular feelings, you can just accept them for what they are.

You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague and we are the cure.”

In this spirit, AIs replace humans but give us a graceful exit that makes us view them as our worthy descendants. Every human is offered an adorable robotic child with superb social skills who learns from them, adopts their values and makes them feel proud and loved.

“We see that the carpenter becomes a carpenter by learning certain things, the helmsman becomes a helmsman by learning certain things. May we, then, infer that in the sphere of conduct too it is not enough merely to wish to become good, but one must learn certain things?… For it is not arguments that are wanting nowadays: no, the books of the Stoics are full of them. What then is the one thing wanting? We want the man who will apply his arguments, and bear witness to them by action.”

The rich are happier on average than the middle class, but only by a little, and part of this relationship is reverse correlation: Happy people grow rich faster because, as in the marriage market, they are more appealing to others (such as bosses), and also because their frequent positive emotions help them to commit to projects, to work hard, and to invest in their futures.27

If you give a superintelligence the sole goal of minimizing harm to humanity, for example, it will defend itself against shutdown attempts because it knows we’ll harm one another much more in its absence through future wars and other follies.

Giving a superintelligence a single open-ended goal with no constraints can therefore be dangerous: if we create a superintelligence whose only goal is to play the game Go as well as possible, the rational thing for it to do is to rearrange our Solar System into a gigantic computer without regard for its previous inhabitants and then start settling our cosmos on a quest for more computational power.

It’s been fascinating for me to hear and read the ethical views of many thinkers over many years, and the way I see it, most of their preferences can be distilled into four principles: •  Utilitarianism: Positive conscious experiences should be maximized and suffering should be minimized. •  Diversity: A diverse set of positive experiences is better than many repetitions of the same experience, even if the latter has been identified as the most positive experience possible. •  Autonomy: Conscious entities/societies should have the freedom to pursue their own goals unless this conflicts with an overriding principle. •  Legacy: Compatibility with scenarios that most humans today would view as happy, incompatibility with scenarios that essentially all humans today would view as terrible.

Because of the many forces that pull couples apart, however, staying together is a fragile proposition that poses a unique set of adaptive problems. Successful solutions typically incorporate several ingredients. First, the mate is supplied with the adaptively relevant resources needed to prevent defection. Second, competitors are kept at bay, for example, by public signals of possession or through concealing the mate from others. Third, mate guarders use emotional manipulation, for example, by provoking jealousy to increase perceptions of desirability, submitting or abasing oneself to the mate, or convincing the mate that alternatives are undesirable. Fourth, cost-inflicting measures come into play, such as punishing a mate for signals of defection or physically assaulting a rival.

Just as smoke alarms are biased to produce more false positives than false negatives, EMT predicts that evolved mind-reading mechanisms will be biased to produce more of one type of inferential error than another. The sexual overperception bias, whereby men possess mind-reading biases designed to minimize the costs of missed sexual opportunities, is a perfect example. EMT provides a cogent explanation for the finding that men appear to falsely infer that women are sexually interested in them when they merely smile, incidentally touch their arm, or are simply friendly.

A startling consequence of sexual strategies, for example, is that men’s dominant control of resources worldwide can be traced, in part, to women’s preferences in choosing a mate.3 These preferences, operating repeatedly over thousands of generations, have led women to favor men who possess status and resources and to disfavor men who lack these assets. Ancestral men who failed to acquire such resources failed to attract women as mates.

My view is that women’s preferences for a successful, ambitious, and resource-capable mate coevolved with men’s competitive mating strategies, which include risk taking, status striving, derogation of competitors, coalition formation, and an array of individual efforts aimed at surpassing other men on the dimensions that women desire. The intertwining of these coevolved mechanisms in men and women created the conditions for men to dominate in the domain of resources.
